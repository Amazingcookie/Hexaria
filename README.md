# Hexaria
An ambient puzzle game about finding patterns in a large stack of hexagons. Made with Game Maker Studio.

**Why open source?**

Ah, game development. If there is one thing just as addictive as gaming, it's this.

However, I like to shift my focus between projects as they come and go. Currently, my brother is building some bonus levels for another game which we hope will be ready soon, and I'm keen on finishing this little 'gem'. I feel like I'm finished with Hexaria now- it is a very complete experience. However, should you be willing to expand on it, then who am I to stop you? 

I have put much effort into making the game as fun as possible, but if you don't like something in the game as it is, or disagree with a game design decision I made, why don't you change it yourself? You can. *That* is the true power of open source.

**Cloning**

 *Instructions*

  This game was made with Game Maker Studio- to be more specific, Standard Edition (v1.3.1307). I haven't tested it on other versions of the engine, so you might run into some bugs when you do that.

If you want the fonts used inside the game, you can find the links to them in the credits. I think this is obvious, but object o_credits has the source text from which you can copy the links.

The only thing missing from this source code is the GameJolt private key, which means you can't access the online leaderboards and all online stuff. As such, I won't tell you how my data storage and all that stuff is structured. The game also reacts slightly differently to some things because of this. However, all code to grab and display the code is still available, for example to use in your own project.

If anything in my weird code jungle boggles you, consider contacting me. I'll be happy to help.

 *What could I use it for?*

Besides the obvious 'improve and build upon the game', I bet that with a bit of changes and a complete revamp of the newcheckvalid() script, you could make a totally new pattern-based game. For example, if you'd take [Sumico](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludomotion.sumico&hl=nl_NL), a game about drawing a line between hexagons, which end up as sums like 2+3-4, I bet that you could remake that out of Hexaria with some changes and willpower.

And otherwise, there are a lot of little code things lied out there that you can learn from or copy to use inside your private projects. Simply because you are so totally allowed to do that.

*Instructions*

My quality assurance ladder lies a bit high, so that means I won't accept any half-baked forks (get it?) to merge into the main branch. You can always try it, of course. Think of something interesting that would really improve the game, and that would fit into the overall style of the game.

Personally, I would like to see some more game modes that take the game to higher levels- such as a mode with  pre-built puzzles instead of an endless mode. However, I'm leaving things up to your imagination when we are thinking about additions.

*Porting*

Although asking you to port Hexaria to iOS or Android might be a bit ridiculous, I'd like to see a Mac or Linux version. If you can get those versions to me, I'll also add them to the official pages on [GameJolt](http://gamejolt.com/games/puzzle/hexaria/44053/) and [itch.io](http://amazingcookie.itch.io/hexaria).

EDIT: Bjarno has ported Hexaria V1000 to Linux.
